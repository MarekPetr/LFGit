.SH NAME
git-annex-upgrade \- upgrade repository
.PP
.SH SYNOPSIS
git annex upgrade
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
Upgrades the repository.
.PP
Each git-annex repository has an annex.version in its git configuration,
that indicates the repository version. When an old repository version
becomes deprecated, git-annex will automatically upgrade it
(unless annex.autoupgraderepository is set to false). To manually upgrade,
you can use this command.
.PP
Sometimes there's a newer repository version that is not the default yet,
and then you can use this command to upgrade to it.
.PP
Currently, git-annex supports upgrades all the way back to version 0, which
was only used by its author. It's expected that git-annex will always
support upgrading from all past repository versions \-\- this is necessary to
allow archives to be taken offline for years and later used.
